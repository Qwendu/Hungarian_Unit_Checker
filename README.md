# Hungarian_Unit_Checker
 A Hungarian Unit Checker for Jai to attempt to statically guarantee unit correctness for numerical programs

This Unitchecker does not cover all of Jai, no structures, no pointers, pretty much only local variables, + - * / and assignments as well as comparisons.
It is written as an exercies in writing Jai Meta Programs.

Check out ``first.jai`` for how to integrate it into your meta program.
Check out ``to_verify.jai`` to see how it looks for your code.
Check out ``Unit.jai`` to critizise my source code / modify suffixes which get recognized as units.


This has no formal reasoning behind it to show its correct/soundness.
